# Neptune Networks Peering Config

This is the pipeline to build [Neptune Networks](https://neptunenetworks.org)' BGP peering configuration. Neptune uses BIRD `2.0.7` on all of its core customer routers and border routers. We rely on this pipeline to take templates and YAML and turn them into a BIRD configuration.

This BGP configuration has been built to be agnostic to Neptune Networks and should work for you as well. An example configuration file can be seen in [`config/router.fqdn.example.yml`](config/router.fqdn.example.yml). Simply create a similar file with the relevant options to your network and execute the generation steps at the bottom of this README.

The YAML files in [`config/`](config/) go through a transformation step in which they turn into [`bird.conf`](out/router.fqdn.example/bird.conf), [`peers.conf`](out/router.fqdn.example/peers.conf), and [`static.conf`](out/router.fqdn.example/static.conf) files in the [`out/`](out/) directory.

## BGP Community Support

The BIRD configuration in this repostiory uses [BGP large communities](http://largebgpcommunities.net/) inspired by [RFC8195](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8195).

### Informational

Informational BGP communities offer insight into Neptune's routing policies.

#### Origin

| Community | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `YOUR_ASN:101:1` | Originated by you |
| `YOUR_ASN:101:2` | Learned from IX |
| `YOUR_ASN:101:3` | Learned from private peer |
| `YOUR_ASN:101:4` | Learned from transit provider |
| `YOUR_ASN:101:5` | Learned from customer |

#### Region

Octets in the function field are the numeric country identifier defined by ISO 3166-1.

| Community | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `YOUR_ASN:102:840` | Learned in U.S. |

#### Site

| Community | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `YOUR_ASN:103:1` | Learned at NY1 |

### Actionable

BGP communities which manipulate the routing policy.

#### Prepends

| Community | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `YOUR_ASN:900:1` | Prepend `YOUR_ASN` once on export to all AS's |
| `YOUR_ASN:900:2` | Prepend `YOUR_ASN` twice on export to all AS's |
| `YOUR_ASN:900:3` | Prepend `YOUR_ASN` thrice on export to all AS's |
| `YOUR_ASN:991:xxxxx` | Prepend `YOUR_ASN` once on export to AS `xxxxx` |
| `YOUR_ASN:992:xxxxx` | Prepend `YOUR_ASN` once on export to AS `xxxxx` |
| `YOUR_ASN:993:xxxxx` | Prepend `YOUR_ASN` once on export to AS `xxxxx` |

#### NO_EXPORT

| Community | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `YOUR_ASN:600:xxxxx` | Do not export to AS `xxxxx` |
| `YOUR_ASN:601:2` | Do not export to IX peers |
| `YOUR_ASN:601:3` | Do not export to private peers |
| `YOUR_ASN:601:4` | Do not export to transit providers |
| `YOUR_ASN:601:5` | Do not export to customers |
| `YOUR_ASN:602:840` | Do not export in U.S. |
| `YOUR_ASN:603:1` | Do not export in NY1 |

## Usage

Start by creating a new `.yml` file in [`config/`](config/) with all of the configurations you'll need. You can use [`config/router.fqdn.example.yml`](config/router.fqdn.example.yml) as a reference.

Once you've tuned your configuration file to your liking, build the docker image locally:

```
script/build
```

And then generate the configuration:

```
script/generate
```

This will create a file for each of the templates defined in [`/templates`](templates/) without the `.erb` suffix in the [`out/`](out/) directory.

If you find that you need to make any adjustments to the templates, simply do so and then re-run the generator.

## Staying up to date

If you use this as a [GitHub Repository template](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/), you will occassionally want to sync your version of the repository with the master one located at [neptune-networks/peering](https://github.com/neptune-networks/peering). To do this, you can run the following commands:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/neptune-networks/peering.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

## Roadmap
